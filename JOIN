# 1 select the 2 tables with a join so that you can see each person's name next to their hobby.
2 Select only the name and hobbies of 'Bobby McBobbyFace', using JOIN combined with WHERE.

SELECT persons.name, hobbies.name FROM persons JOIN hobbies ON persons.id=hobbies.person_id;

SELECT persons.name, hobbies.name FROM persons 
JOIN hobbies ON persons.id=hobbies.person_id WHERE persons.name LIKE "%Bobby McBobbyFace%";

In this project, you’re going to make your own table with some small set of 
“famous people”, then make more tables about things they do and join those to
create nice human readable lists.
