#In this SQL code, I'm querying a database that's holding songs data to answer questions about the data
1 You'll use queries to decide what songs to sing. For the first step, select all the song titles.
2 Add another SELECT that uses OR to show the titles of the songs that have an 'epic' mood or a release date after 1990.
3 Add another SELECT that uses AND to show the titles of songs that are 'epic', and released after 1990, and less than 4 minutes long.
Note that the duration column is measured in seconds.

SELECT title FROM songs;
SELECT title FROM songs WHERE released > 1990 OR mood = "epic";
SELECT title FROM songs WHERE released > 1990 AND duration < 4 AND mood = "epic";
SELECT title FROM songs WHERE released > 1990 AND mood = "epic" AND duration < 240;
