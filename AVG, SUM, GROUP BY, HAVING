#In this SQL code, I'm querying a database that's holding books data to answer questions about the data
1 Select all the authors who have written more than 1 million words, using GROUP BY and HAVING. Your results table should include the 'author' and their total word count as a 'total_words' column.
2 Now select all the authors that write more than an average of 150,000 words per book. 

SELECT author, SUM(words) 
 AS total_words 
FROM books 
 GROUP BY author 
HAVING total_words > 1000000;

SELECT author, AVG(words) 
 AS avg_words 
FROM books 
 GROUP BY author 
HAVING avg_words > 150000;
